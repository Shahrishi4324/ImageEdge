# Image Edge Detection with OpenCV

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform edge detection on images using the Canny edge detection algorithm in OpenCV. The process involves converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur, and then detecting edges.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib (optional for displaying images)

You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install opencv-python matplotlib
```

Run with 
```bash
python ImageEdge.py
```
